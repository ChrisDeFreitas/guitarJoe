# GuitarJoe
GuitarJoe is a web based tool that allows you to visually explore the guitar fretboard, scales, chords, intervals and notes. The current version is a proof of concept.  

The application is published to the web through <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a>.  I plan to leave it publicly accessible until it wears out its GitHub welcome. So you can use and share it via the GitHub.io link that publishes the ./docs folder for public access:  https://chrisdefreitas.github.io/guitarjoe  

The goal was to create a tool that would make guitar theory accessible while practicing.  I was going crazy taking notes and diagramming chords, scales and intervals: I needed a tool to facilitate my understanding so I could focus on the guitar instead of managing scraps of information.  This application has successfully reduced my hair loss--I hope it has the same effect on you!

The name is based on the slang "Joe Workie," a synonym for construction worker. At the tender age of 12 it felt like one of those adults terms I had to learn--it wasn't. In this context, GuitarJoe does the heavy lifting of translating music theory to the guitar fretboard.  Here is a screenshot of my first use of the application.  I am working on playig with 5 fingers and use triplets to exercise my pinky.  It was a transformative moment, focusing on the notes in front of me instead of scribbled diagrams:

## Music Theory
I am not a musician (I often say I'll be ready to play in a band around the age of 90).  So the data is taken from Wikipedia and verified against other online sources.  The Blues Heptatonic scale has different representations online, so it is debatable.  I love learning about cultures and history so I've included some exotic scales like the Japanes Akebono I and II for practice.  Please forward any discrepancies to me.  

## Technical Notes
- The entire application is contained within the single web page; it does not require a remote server.  The only external link is to the <a href='https://fonts.google.com/?query=Robert+Leuschke/' target='_new'>Fuggles Google Font</a> used in the header. So one could use the ./docs folder on any webserver.
- The logic of the application resides in <a href='https://github.com/ChrisDeFreitas/guitarjoe/blob/main/src/guitar_lib.js'>guitar_lib.js</a>--the code should be readable by non-techies so  feel free to review/use/suggest changes.  I created the library's test suite as I initially built the library, so it will not test all functionality. The test suite is used primarily to develop complex funcitonality, such as guitar_lib.notes.match() that matches a list of notes to a list of intervals.
- In terms of security, the application currently does not store or access browser data.  The future plans include saving/restoring application state using <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage'>HTML5 Local Storage</a>--but that is way in the future.
- The application is a standard <a href='https://create-react-app.dev/'>Create React App</a>, except the ./build folder is renamed to ./docs to work with <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a>.  See <a href='https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration'>BUILD_PATH environment variable</a> for details on that redirection.

## Updates

202109__:  
Finally added the ability to select frets, then view scales and chords containing those notes (it's been a probelm vexing me for a while). The new mode is called "Fret Select" and appears automatically after you click the second fret.  The list of related scales and chords will appear below within the InfoPnl, click one to have it drawn on the fretboard.  I've limited the scales searched to the typical Western ones: Major, Minor, Pentatonic, and Blues--this is easily changed.  As usual everything is clickable, so please experiment to learn about the functionality.   

Research into unusual scales found that pentatonic scales are [ancient, and common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale) throughout the world. I thought it would be interesting to experiment with those intervals while practising so I added the Japanese Akebono I and II, and the Pygmy scales.  They appear to be consistently referenced across the web, and used in many cultures. In this context its important to note that the Western Pentatonic Major and Minor scales are native to many cultures from the past and the present. Also note, I couldn't find any theoretical references to the Pygmy scale but it is consistently used in modern Handpans and Tongue drums.   

- upgraded to v.0.1.3
- refactored Fretboard.state.fretFilter into array  
- implemented fretSelect mode: clicking multiple frets displays related chords and scales
- added green highlight when mouse hovers over items in InfoPnl
- clicking a label in the InfoPnl will turn off all manually highlighted notes, scales, and chords
- added scales: Akebono I (aka "Dorian Pentatonic"), Akebono II (aka "Hon-kumoi-joshi"), and the Pygmy Scale (aka "Aeolian Pentatonic").  Links to references are in their [guitar_lib.scales.list[]](https://github.com/ChrisDeFreitas/guitarjoe/blob/ce89942765f278a7b95613d9fbc8cd37ede71d7e/src/guitar_lib.js#L393) definition.
- changed short form of Natural minor triad to "Minor" from "Nat.min" for readability, and to conform to the confusing standard of notating all minor scales the same way.
- clicking a fret with a button, will now route to buttonClick() instead of fretClick()

20210914:  
- refactored to create guitar_lib.notes; created consistent nomenclature for notes and note objects
- refactored guitar_lib.fretboard: fret is an integer, fobj is an object returned by fretboard.obj()
- various fixes, tweaks, and optimizations

20210911:  
- changed the Selected fret button background color to green  
- clicking a fret button now Selects the button (green background color) despite the previous button state (fretRoot, selRoot, or noteFilter)
- fixed bug: when an Interval is selected, the root fret button now displays the P1 interval caption
- when a fret is clicked (a fret root selected), and an Interval is selected, mathching notes within 4 frets will appear. Previously, the range was 3 notes.

20210909:  
- Email address update.

20210908:  
This update allows note buttons to be highlighted by clicking on a note in the InfoPnl.  Once a note is selected within the InfoPnl, it will remain selected until clicked again or the reset button is clicked.  To save space, when the queryPnl is collapsed, fret numbers will be replaced by green 
bars over the 5,7,9 and 12 frets.  The click to disable fret functionality will remain
active when collapsed.

- upgraded to v.0.1.2
- on collapse fret numbers hidden, 5,7,9,12 replaced by green line
- clicking a note in the InfoPnl changes background color of similar fretButtons to blue
- created style for header buttons
- renamed ./public/logo.svg to favicon.svg
- refactored: guitar_lib.fretboard, included string and fret functions  
- refactored fretPnl.button()
- refactored to create button.dataset.selected and associated css
- installed source-map-explorer, found no glaring errors


20210905:  
This was a rewrite of the interval calculation functionality.  Originally based on semitones but that lost track of the â­/# info.  The new algorithm took a long time to develop and ripped the guts out of the app.  But it works well and has room for expansion, see [guitar_lib.letterCalc()](https://github.com/ChrisDeFreitas/guitarjoe/blob/6cee48132713c0c7bd2a7d21f468f1c74f2fb70e/src/guitar_lib.js#L253).  In the testing I fixed many transcription errors in scales, chords and intervals--another bonus for the grueling effort.  

Usage of â­â­ and ## removed from app. This simplifies manipulation of intervals by the library.  It is assumed anyone needing to calculate â­â­ and ## have requirements beyond the scope of the guitar fretboard.  

- upgraded to v.0.1.1
- fixed bug: selecting C# Major scale, InfoPnl displays Dâ­, Eâ­...; should be C#, D#; need logic to display sharp vs flat consistently  
-- rewrote guitar_lib.letterCalc() because the algorithm was based on semitones  
-- removed guitar_lib.letterBySemis() because the the idea was wrong  
-- refactored code using letterBySemis() to use the new letterCalc()  
-- refactoring affected most operations so it is a big update  
- scale and chord definition error updates
- added Phrygian dominant scale   


## ToDo
- fix query collapse/expand arrow buttons: refactor code to simplify
- fix ./public/favicon.svg colors: image appears dim on white backgrounds  
- browser bug: zooming out causes random frets and strings to disappear (assume due to x/y location; test by adjusting)   
- refactor Fretboard.state.strgFltrList to be array (rename to strgFilter)  
- refactor FretPnl.render(): simplify, optimize  
- add a screenshot to Readme.md  
- selChord update, add Inversions:  
-- when a chord is selected, display possible inversions in the infoPnl  
-- clicking an inversion will highlight related notes (similar to fretSelect mode for chords and scales)  
-- use same color as fretSelect/click InfoPnl items   
- add backup feature:  
-- allow multiple backups by user assigning backup name  
-- default backup name = 'Auto', will restore on startup; others must be manually loaded by user   
-- add header button: Backups  
-- functions: backup, restore, delete, save/load from file?  
-- default save to Local Storage  
- FretSelect mode update: create an interface allowing the chords and scales looked up to be filtered
- when selecting a Scale from the QryPnl: allow selected chords and intervals to be overlayed by altering their button colors; change the respective select control's color to match the button color.  Currently, no distinction is made beyond the InfoPnl data.
- allow for number and range of frets to changed by user 
- add ability to play videos in background  
- dig into source-map-explorer details
